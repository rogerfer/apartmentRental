This project analyzes apartment data across different cities and states. 
The data was first processed and explored using Jupyter Notebook, where key transformations and initial analyses were performed. Then, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards, visualizing insights such as average prices, total revenue, apartment sizes, and clustering patterns. 
The final report provides a clear overview of trends and correlations between apartment features.
